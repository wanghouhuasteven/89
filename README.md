# 89

This is the first project of mine.

I've met a easy but boring math question:
>Here's a number 123**, please fill the blanks(actually *s) and make it become a mutiple of 89. What can you fill?

So I wrote this python 3.6 program to keep me away from boring questions like this~

When you run this program(it has been writen by zh-cn):   
First you need to input 12300 when the stem tells you that the number is 123**;   
Then, input 0 anyway;   
Input the upper limit of the addition;   
Input the divisor to get the answer.

Thanks!
